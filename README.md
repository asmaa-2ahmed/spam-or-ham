# üì© SMS Spam Classifier (BoW)

A machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using Bag-of-Words (BoW) with enhanced preprocessing.

---

## üîç Overview

This project implements a robust SMS spam classifier using:

* **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** representation with `CountVectorizer`
* **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classification algorithm
* **Enhanced text preprocessing** with lemmatization and bigrams
* **Probability calibration** to reduce overconfident predictions

**Model Accuracy**: 98.2%
**Spam Recall**: 91%

## üì¶ Dataset

The dataset used for training this model is the **SMS Spam Collection**.
üì• **Download it from here**: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
Ensure it is placed in the `assets/data/` directory and named `SMSSpamCollection` (a tab-separated `.txt` file with no extension).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Advanced Text Processing

* Lemmatization (more accurate than stemming)
* Bigram support to capture important phrases
* Comprehensive stopword removal
* Punctuation and number removal

### Optimized Classification

* Class weighting to handle imbalance
* Precision-recall optimized threshold
* Probability calibration for confidence scoring

### Easy-to-Use Interface

* Streamlit web app for interactive testing
* Clear confidence scores
* Visual feedback for user input

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asmaa-2ahmed/spam-or-ham.git
cd spam-or-ham
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Web App

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will launch in your default browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## üß† Model Training

To retrain the model with custom data:

1. Place your dataset in `assets/data/` and name it `SMSSpamCollection`
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This will:

* Preprocess the data
* Train a new model
* Save updated model files to `assets/models/`
* Generate evaluation metrics

---

## üß™ Testing the Model

Try these example messages:

**Spam Examples**:

* "Congratulations! You won a \$1000 gift card! Click here: bit.ly/freeprizes"
* "URGENT: Your account has been locked. Verify now: secure-login.com"

**Ham Examples**:

* "Hey, running late for dinner. Will be there by 8"
* "Your Amazon verification code is 794321. Expires in 15 minutes."

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

* Lowercasing
* Punctuation removal
* Tokenization
* Lemmatization (using `WordNetLemmatizer`)
* Stopword removal
* Bigram generation

### Model Architecture

* **Vectorizer**: `CountVectorizer` with 5,000 features
* **Classifier**: Multinomial Naive Bayes with class weighting
* **Threshold**: Optimized via precision-recall analysis

### Performance Metrics

| Metric         | Score |
